Think of a team you are either currently on or have been a part of. You can also use a famous team if you like. Create a charter that you think will help the team perform at its best and post it in the discussion forum. Make sure to address goals, roles and norms. You should also look through other students’ charters and provide feedback on what you think works well or where you think their charter could be improved.
We believe that agile philosophy and methodologies:

 1) create more human workplaces and bring happiness at work; 

 2) facilitate a greater mix of the skills and knowledge within the pluridisciplinary team; 

 3) bring more engagement from team members through autonomy, mastery, purpose; 

 4) give a chance to have quicker and regular feedback from the market; 

 5) deliver in the end the right business value to the team's clients; 

 6) creates trust between frontline teams and top management within an organization.



And that's why we want to influence top management and investors to open up to the philosophy, because without them, the benefits of agility would not be felt across the company and will create tensions between departments, especially if the organization is structured in silos.



Each consultant working with Enjoy Agile philosophy has to:

1) be patient to understand the client's context and not judge too quickly the client's culture before to suggest change; 

2) ask for help to the Enjoy Agile community if necessary to query the collective intelligence to better serve the client; 

3) can ask for in person help from another Enjoy Agile senior consultant if necessary; 

4) participate to Return of Experience (REX) and give internal talks herself or himself to share knowledge with colleagues;  

5) share knowledge publicly through either blog writing, meetups, conferences at least 4 times a year;

6) has to participate to the hiring process at least 4 times a year; 

7) can be asked to be a mediator to a conflict between two consultants.
