Couplet 1
You're the one being strong
To strive against a fate you deny
One you never asked for
One you seem to hold on to now
Just like you knew
What matters lies ahead of you
I believe it too
 
Refrain
In the meantime
Brother you can love an' share like every one of us do
In the meantime
Brother you can lead the way if you want to
Don't be frail
It's no use
 
Couplet 2
We've been caught in the thrill
Of time we never thought to rewind
Who you were as a child
And how you wanted me by your side
It's nothing new
I confess to you even I want to
As any brother would

Refrain 
In the meantime
Brother you can love an' share like every one of us do
In the meantime
Brother you can lead the way wherever you want to
It's OK, I'm with you
 
Ending
In the meantime
I will keep the shades away, and your path lit
In the meantime
Even if I'm long gone anyway
I'm the one by your side everyday
It's meant to last
'cause I'll never stop to pave your way
To watch over your every steps
It's meant to last
For we brothers had a bond right from the start
